Low Level Functions
===================

In this chapter we will learn about the low level functions provided by Ring

* callgc()
* varptr()
* space()
* nullpointer()
* object2pointer()
* pointer2object()

callgc() function
=================

Use this function to force calling the garbage collector during function execution when you
use a loop that create temp. variables that you don't free using the assignment operation.

It's very rare to need this function but it's useful when you create something like event-loop
for your game engine and start creating lists on the fly when you call functions.

Example 

.. code-block:: none

	While True

		# process events
		# call functions using temp. lists like myfunc(["temp list"])

		# call the garbage collector
		callgc()
	End

.. tip:: In Ring the garbage collector works automatically in the end of function execution or
	 when you use the assignment statement.


varptr() function
=================

Use the varptr() function when you need to pass a pointer to a C/C++ function.

Syntax:

	varptr(cVariableName,cPointerType) ---> Low Level Object (C Pointer)

example:

.. code-block:: none

	r = 10
	z = 20
	see r + nl
	see varptr("r","int") 
	see varptr("z","int")

Output:

.. code-block:: none

	10
	00E3C740
	int
	2
	00E3BEC0
	int
	2

.. note:: the low level object is a list contains three items (The Pointer, The Type, The Status)
