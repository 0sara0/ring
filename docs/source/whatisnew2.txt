The find() function is updated to support searching in lists using C pointers like GUI
Objects.

The type() function is updated to display the C pointers types (like the GUI Object Class

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Better Ring Notepad

Better Ring Notepad
===================

The Ring Notepad will save the current line number of opened file to be restored when
we switch between files.

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Better RingQt

Better RingQt
=============

RingQt classes are updated to include methods to get events (The code that will be executed
when an event is fired). This is necessary to enable/disable events for some time or to
get the events information.

For example the next code disable an event then call a method then enable the event again.

.. code-block:: ring

	cEvent = oView.oListResult.getCurrentItemChangedEvent()
	oView.oListResult.setCurrentItemChangedEvent("")
	FindValueAction()	# Call Method while an event is disabled
	oView.oListResult.setCurrentItemChangedEvent(cEvent)

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Better Call Command

Better Call Command
===================

The Call command is updated to support calling functions from object attributes also (not
only variables).

For example the next code from the Stars Fighter Game

.. code-block:: ring

	cFunc = oself.keypress
	call cFunc(oGame,oSelf,Key_Space)

Can be written in one line

.. code-block:: ring

	call oself.keypress(oGame,oSelf,Key_Space)


.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Using NULL instead of NULLPointer()

Using NULL instead of NULLPointer()
===================================

We can pass NULL to functions instead of using NULLPointer()

For example the next code from RingLibSDL

.. code-block:: ring

	SDL_RenderCopy(SDL_ren,tex,NULLPointer(),rect)

Can be written as in the next line

.. code-block:: ring

	SDL_RenderCopy(SDL_ren,tex,NULL,rect)

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Better Quality

Better Quality
==============

Ring 1.2 is more stable, We discovered and fixed more bugs during Ring usage everyday
in practical projects. 

Also the documentation is more better.

And more!
