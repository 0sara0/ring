What is new in Ring 1.2?
========================

In this chapter we will learn about the changes and new features in Ring 1.2 release.

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; List of changes and new features

List of changes and new features
================================

Ring 1.2  comes with many new features 

* New Functions
* Better Functions
* Better Ring Notepad
* Better RingQt
* Objects Library for RingQt

* Using NULL instead of NULLPointer()
* Display Warnings Option
* Better Quality

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; New Functions

New Functions
=============

* PtrCmp() Function is a new function that compare between C pointers like the GUI objects.
* PrevFileName() Function is added to return the previous active source file name.
* RingVM_CFunctionsList() Function is added to return a list of functions written in C.
* RingVM_FunctionsList() Function is added to return a list of functions written in Ring.
* RingVM_ClassesList() Function is added to return a list of Classes.
* RingVM_PackagesList() Function is added to return a list of Packages.
* RingVM_MemoryList() Function is added to return a list of Memory Scopes and Variables.
* RingVM_CallList() Function is added to return a list of the functions call list.
* RingVM_FilesList() Function is added to return a list of the Ring Files.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	fp = fopen("ptrcmp.ring","r")
	fp2 = fp
	fp3 = fopen("ptrcmp.ring","r")

	see ptrcmp(fp,fp2) + nl
	see ptrcmp(fp,fp3) + nl

	fclose(fp)
	fclose(fp3)

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	1
	0

Example:

The next function in stdlib.ring uses the PrevFileName() to know if the file of the
caller function is the main source file of the program or not.

.. code-block:: ring

	Func IsMainSourceFile
		if PrevFileName() = sysargv[2]
			return true
		ok
		return false

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Better Functions

Better Functions
================

The find() function is updated to support searching in lists using C pointers like GUI
Objects.

The type() function is updated to display the C pointers types (like the GUI Object Class
Name).

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Better Ring Notepad

Better Ring Notepad
===================

The Ring Notepad will save the current line number of opened files to be restored when
we switch between files.

Also Ring Notepad will ask the user to save the file if the file content is changed when 
the user switch between files.

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Better RingQt

Better RingQt
=============

RingQt classes are updated to include methods to get events (The code that will be executed
when an event is fired). This is necessary to enable/disable events for some time or to
get the events information.

For example the next code disable an event then call a method then enable the event again.

.. code-block:: ring

	cEvent = oView.oListResult.getCurrentItemChangedEvent()
	oView.oListResult.setCurrentItemChangedEvent("")
	FindValueAction()	# Call Method while an event is disabled
	oView.oListResult.setCurrentItemChangedEvent(cEvent)

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Objects Library for RingQt

Objects Library for RingQt
==========================

Ring 1.2 comes with the Objects library for RingQt applications. Instead of using global
variables for windows objects and connecting events to objects using the object name, the
Objects Library will manage the GUI objects and will provide a more natural API to quickly
create one or many windows from the same class and the library provide a way to quickly set methods
to be executed when an event is fired. Also the library provide a natural interface to
quickly use the parent or the caller windows from the child or sub windows.

The Objects Library is designed to be used with the MVC Design Pattern.

The Objects Library is merged in RingQt so you can use it directly when you use RingQt

Example :

.. code-block:: ring

	load "guilib.ring"

	new qApp {
		open_window( :MainWindowController )
		exec()
	}

	class MainWindowController from WindowsControllerParent
		oView = new MainWindowView
		func SubWindowAction
			open_window( :SubWindowController )
			Last_Window().SetParentObject(self)

	class MainWindowView
		win = new qWidget() {
			SetWindowTitle("Main Window")
			btnSub = new qPushButton(win) {
				setText("Sub Window")
				setClickEvent( Method( :SubWindowAction ) )
			}
			resize(400,400)
		}

	class SubWindowController from WindowsControllerParent
		oView = new SubWindowView
		func SetMainWindowTitleAction
			Parent().oView.win.SetWindowTitle("Message from the Sub Window")
			oView.win.SetWindowTitle("Click Event Done!")

	class SubWindowView
		win = new qWidget() {
			SetWindowTitle("Sub Window")
			btnSub = new qPushButton(win) {
				setText("Set Main Window Title")
				setClickEvent( Method( :SetMainWindowTitleAction ) )
			}
			resize(400,400)
		}



.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Better Call Command

Better Call Command
===================

The Call command is updated to support calling functions from object attributes also (not
only variables).

For example the next code from the Stars Fighter Game

.. code-block:: ring

	cFunc = oself.keypress
	call cFunc(oGame,oSelf,Key_Space)

Can be written in one line

.. code-block:: ring

	call oself.keypress(oGame,oSelf,Key_Space)


.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Using NULL instead of NULLPointer()

Using NULL instead of NULLPointer()
===================================

We can pass NULL to functions instead of using NULLPointer()

For example the next code from RingLibSDL

.. code-block:: ring

	SDL_RenderCopy(SDL_ren,tex,NULLPointer(),rect)

Can be written as in the next line

.. code-block:: ring

	SDL_RenderCopy(SDL_ren,tex,NULL,rect)

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Display Warnings Option

Display Warnings Option
=======================

In Ring 1.2 the Ring compiler is updated to include the Display Warnings option (-w)

Example:

.. code-block:: ring
	
	load "stdlib.ring"
	load "stdlib.ring"

compiling the program using the Display Warnings option will display the file duplication
warning, While without that option the error will pass silent.

This is a warning (not an error) because in large projects you may use the same file
more than one time. For example it's common to start each file with the next code. where
the function IsMainSourceFile() is part from the stdlib.ring

.. code-block:: ring

	load "stdlib.ring"
	if IsMainSourceFile() 
		// Testing
	ok 

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.2?; Better Quality

Better Quality
==============

Ring 1.2 is more stable, We discovered and fixed more bugs during Ring usage everyday
in practical projects. Some functions are optimized to be faster like the SubStr() function.
Also the documentation is more better.
