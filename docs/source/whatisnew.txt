* Syntax Flexibility and differnt styles for I/O and Control Structures
* New Functions written in C
* StdLib functions and classes written in Ring
* RingLibSDL 
* Demo Project - Game Engine for 2D Games
* RingSQLite
* Better Code Generator for Extensions 
* Better Documentation

Better Natural Language Programming Support
===========================================

Ring is an innovative language because of it's compact syntax, smart implementation (small, transparent & visual)
and it's ability to create declarative and natural domain specific languages in a fraction of time.

This release add support for calling methods when an expression is evaluated

check this example:

.. code-block:: none

	# Natural Code
	new program {
		get 2 numbers then print the sum
	}

	# Natural Code Implementation
	class program
		# Keywords
			get=0 numbers=0 then=0 print=0 the=0 sum=0

		# Execution
		func braceexpreval x
			value = x
		func getnumbers
			for x=1 to value
				see "Enter Number ("+x+") :" give nNumber
				aNumbers + nNumber
			next
		func getsum
			nSUm = 0
			for x in aNumbers nSum+= x next
			see "The Sum : " + nSum
		private
			value=0	aNumbers=[]
		
Output: 

.. code-block:: none

	Enter Number (1) :3
	Enter Number (2) :4
	The Sum : 7

for more information see the "Natural Language Programming" chapter.


Generate/Execute Ring Object Files (*.ringo)
============================================

This feature enable you to distribute your applications without distributing
the source code. Also it makes application distribution a simple process where
you get one Ring object file for the complete project (many source code files).
Also using Ring object file remove the loading time required for compiling the application.

Check the "command line options" chapter to know more about this feature.
