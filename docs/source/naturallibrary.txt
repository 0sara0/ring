Using the Natural Library
=========================

In this chapter we will learn how to use the Natural Library to quickly define a language
that contains a group of commands.

To start using the library, We need to call naturallib.ring

.. code-block:: ring

	load "naturallib.ring"

After loading the library, We can use the NaturalLanguage class that contains the 
next methods :-

* SetLanguageName(cLanguageName)
* setCommandsPath(cFolder)
* SetPackageName(cPackageName)
* UseCommand(cCommandName)
* SetOperators(cOperators)
* RunFile(cFileName)
* RunString(cString)
