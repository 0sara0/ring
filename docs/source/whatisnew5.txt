Better Ring Notepad
===================

(1) Ring Notepad is updated to include some new styles and the Main File ToolBar

The idea of the Main File ToolBar is to determine the main file in the project
When the project contains many source code files

This way you can run the project ( Main File ) at any time while opening other files in the project
without the need to switch to the Main File to run the project.


To quickly use this feature

(Open the project main file)

Press Ctrl+Shift+M  to set the current source code file as the main file


Open and modify other source code files in the project

To run the project (Main File) at any time press Ctrl+Shift+F5 (GUI) or Ctrl+Shift+D (Console)
