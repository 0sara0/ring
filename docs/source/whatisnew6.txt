Better Ring For Android
=======================

Ring For Android (using RingQt) is updated to use the Ring Object File ( *.ringo ) instead of using
many source code files ( *.ring )

The next screen shot is an example of building the cards game for Android

We are using cards.ringo instead of cards.ring

If you have large project (many *.ring files) it will use only one *.ringo file.
