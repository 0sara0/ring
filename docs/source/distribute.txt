Distributing Applications for Microsoft Windows
===============================================

Step 1:

.. code-block:: none

	Copy c:\ring\bin folder to be for example c:\myapp

Step 2:

.. code-block:: none

	Rename c:\myapp\ring.exe to c:\myapp\myapp.exe

Step 3:

.. code-block:: none

	Create a file c:\myapp\ring.ring 

And write

.. code-block:: ring

	Load "myapp.ring"

When you run myapp.exe the file ring.ring will be executed automatically

So your file myapp.ring will be called and executed

Or just rename myapp.ring to ring.ring

It's a fast way to distribute applications.

Protecting the Source Code
==========================

Step 1:

Execute the next command 

.. code-block:: none

	ring myapp.ring -go

This will generate one object file (myapp.ringo) from the project files (*.ring)

Step 2:

.. code-block:: none

	Rename myapp.ringo to ring.ringo

When you run the executable file (ring.exe) or (myapp.exe) the file ring.ringo will be executed.
