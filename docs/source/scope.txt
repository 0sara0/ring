Scope Rules
===========

In Ring we have three scopes :-

(1) Public/Global Scope - Each variable you define in the statements part (before functions and classes)

(2) Object Scope - When you are inside an object (Inside class method or using { } to access the object )

(3) Local Scope - Related to functions and methods
