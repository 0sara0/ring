Scope Rules
===========

In this chapter we will learn about scope rules and how ring find variables.

Also we will learn about conflicts and how to solve/avoid them.

These information are important once you start developing large applications with Ring
That uses Global variables, Classes and braces { } to access objects 

Three Scopes 
============

In Ring we have three scopes :-

(1) Public/Global Scope - Each variable you define in the statements part (before functions and classes)

(2) Object Scope - When you are inside an object (Inside class method or using { } to access the object )

(3) Local Scope - Related to functions and methods

Defining Variables and Variables Access
=======================================

* Ring uses lexical scoping, i.e. the scope of the variable is based on where 
we defined the variable.

* Inside braces {  } when you access an object - you still can access the global
scope and the local scope.

* After Class keyword and name , when you write variable names to define the class attributes
You still can access the global scope.

* Function Parameters are already defined in the local scope.
