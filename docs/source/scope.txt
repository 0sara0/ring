Scope Rules
===========

In this chapter we will learn about scope rules and how ring find variables.

Also we will learn about conflicts and how to solve/avoid them.

These information are important once you start developing large applications with Ring
That uses Global variables, Classes and braces { } to access objects 

Three Scopes 
============

In Ring we have three scopes :-

(1) Public/Global Scope - Each variable you define in the statements part (before functions and classes)

(2) Object Scope - When you are inside an object (Inside class method or using { } to access the object )

(3) Local Scope - Related to functions and methods
