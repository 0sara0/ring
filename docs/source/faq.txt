Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

What is the goal of including the "Main" function in Ring?
==========================================================

The main function is very important, you need it when you want to write statements that uses 
local variables instead of the Global scope.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

	x = 10
	myfunc()
	See "X value = " + X  # here i expect that x will be (10)
        	              # but i will get another value (6) because myfunc() uses x !
	Func myfunc
	   for x = 1 to 5
	       See x + nl
	   next

Output:

.. code-block:: none

	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	X value = 6

Now using the Main function

.. code-block:: none

	Func Main 
	   x = 10
	   myfunc()
	   See "X value = " + X                         

	Func myfunc
	   for x = 1 to 5
	       See x + nl
	   next

Output

.. code-block:: none

	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	X value = 10

Why the list index start from 1 in Ring?
========================================

It\’s about how we count in the real world, when we have three apples in our hand

we say 1 2 3 

We don\'t start from 0

The question must be why the other languages start from 0 ?

The answer is, because this is related to the machine and how we deal with values and memory address.

Example

we have array called myarray[5]

In memory : myarray will have an address

The first item will be stored in that address

The second item will come after that address and so on

Now when we need to point to the first item we need the address of myarray

So we type myarray[0] because myarray + 0 result will still point to the first item

for the second item myarray[1] because myarray + 1 result will point to the second item and so on

In Low Level languages or languages near to the machine it\'s good to be like this

But for high level language designed for applications it\’s better to be natural

Example

.. code-block:: none

	mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]
	for x = 1 to len(mylist)
		see x + nl
	next

In the previous example we start from 1 to the length of the array
if the index starts from 0 we will write

.. code-block:: none

	for x = 0 to len(mylist)-1

or remember the for loop in other languages

.. code-block:: none

	for(x=0 ; x<nMax ; x++ )

You will use the < operator !
