Loading the Trace library
=========================

To start using the Trace library, We must load it first!

.. code-block:: ring

	load "tracelib.ring"

.. index:: 
	pair: The Trace Library and the Interactive Debugger; Trace All Events

Trace All Events
================

The next example demonstrates the Trace library usage to trace all events.

... code-block:: ring

	# Trace All Events
	trace(:AllEvents)

	see "Hello, world!" + nl
	see "Welcome" + nl
	see "How are you?" +nl

	mytest()

	new myclass { mymethod() }

	func mytest
		see "Message from mytest" + nl

	class myclass
		func mymethod
			see "Message from mymethod" + nl
