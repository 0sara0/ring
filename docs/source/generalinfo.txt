Ring Architecture
=================

We have the next architecture

(1) Ring Applications (Your Code)  - Written in Ring - See folder : ring/applications
(2) Ring Libraries (StdLib, WebLib, GameEngine, etc) - Written in Ring - See folder : ring/ringlibs
(3) Ring Extensions (RingAllegro, RingQt, etc) - Written in C/C++ (may include Ring code) - See folder : ring/extensions
(4) Ring Virtual Machine (Ring VM) - Written in C language
(5) Operating System (Current Platform) - (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, etc)

The extensions are just dynamic libraries (DLL, So, Dylib)
You can update the extensions without the need to update your code.


ring\libdepwin ====> C libraries used for building Ring Extensions (written in C) on Windows platform.

ring\ringlibs ====> Ring libraries written in Ring itself (StdLib, WebLib, GameEngine, etc)

ring\rnoteexe ====> Just C source file to create executable file that will run rnote.ring

ring\visualsrc ====> The Visual Source Code of the Ring Compiler & Ring VM developed using Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT)

We use the term Ring Library ---> When the library code is written in Ring
We use the term Ring Extension ---> When the library code is Written in C or C++
