In this chapter we will learn about the basic concepts behind the language design.

Why Ring?
=========

The language is simple, trying to be natural, encourage organization and comes 
with transparent and visual implementation. It comes with compact syntax and a
group of features that enable the programmer to create natural interfaces and
declarative domain-specific languages in a fraction of time. It is very small,
fast and comes with smart garbage collector that puts the memory under the 
programmer control. It supports many programming paradigms, comes with useful 
and practical libraries. The language is designed for productivity and developing
high quality solutions that can scale.
