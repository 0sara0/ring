.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.13?; RingStbImage Extension

RingStbImage Extension
======================

New extension support the stb_image library

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	# Load the library
		load "stbimage.ring"
	# Image Information
		width=0	height=0 channels=0
	# Ring will Free cData automatically in the end of the program
		cData = stbi_load("ring.jpg",:width,:height,:channels,STBI_rgb)
	# Display the output
		? "Size (bytes): " + len(cData)
		? "Width : " + width
		? "Height: " + height
		? "Channels: " + channels

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	Size (bytes): 557371
	Width : 563
	Height: 330
	Channels: 3
