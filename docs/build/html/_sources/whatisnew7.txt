.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; New Command: Load Package

New Command: Load Package
=========================

Using the 'load' command we can use many ring source files in the same project

But all of these files will share the same global scope 

Now we have the "Load Package" command too

Using "Load Package" we can load a library (*.ring file) in new global scope

This is very useful to create libraries that avoid conflicts in global variables

Example:

File: loadpackage.ring

.. code-block:: ring

	x = 100
	? "Hello, World!"
	load package "testloadpackage.ring"

	? x
	test()

File: testloadpackage.ring

.. code-block:: ring

	? "Hello from testloadpackage.ring"

	x = 1000

	test()

	func test
		? x

Output:

.. code-block:: none

	Hello, World!
	Hello from testloadpackage.ring
	1000
	100
	1000



.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; ringvm_see() and ringvm_give() functions

ringvm_see() and ringvm_give() functions
========================================

Using the ringvm_see() function we can redefine the behavior of the See command

Also we can use ring_see() to have the original behavior

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	see "Hello world" + nl
	see 123 + nl
	see ["one","two","three"]
	see new point {x=10 y=20 z=30} 

	func ringvm_see t
		ring_see("We want to print: ")
		ring_See(t)

	class point x y z

Output:

.. code-block:: none

	We want to print: Hello world
	We want to print: 123
	We want to print: one
	two
	three
	We want to print: x: 10.000000
	y: 20.000000
	z: 30.000000

Using the ringvm_give() function we can redefine the behavior of the Give command

Also we can use ring_give() to have the original behavior

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	see "Name: " give name
	see "Hello " + name

	func ringvm_give
		see "Mahmoud" + nl
		return "Mahmoud"

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	Name: Mahmoud
	Hello Mahmoud

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; ring_state_new() and ring_state_mainfile() functions

ring_state_new() and ring_state_mainfile() functions
====================================================

Using ring_state_new() and ring_state_mainfile() we can run Ring programs from Ring programs

But unlike ring_state_main(), Here we can control when to delete the Ring state!

This is important when we run GUI programs from GUI programs

Because they will share the GUI Library (RingQt), And In this case the caller will call

qApp.Exec()

So the sub program, will not stop and will return to the Main program

Here deleting the State of the sub programs will lead to a problem when we run the sub program events

So keeping the state is important for sub GUI programs hosted in GUI programs.


.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; Better Trace Library

Better Trace Library
====================

The Trace library is updated, In the Debugger at break points we have now the "callstack" command

This command will print the functions call stack.

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	load "tracelib.ring"

	func main
		? "Hello from main!"
		test1()

	func test1 
		? "Hello from test1!"
		test2()

	func test2 
		? "Hello from test2!"
		test3()

	func test3 
		? "Hello from test3!"
		breakpoint()

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; Better Ring Notepad

Better Ring Notepad
===================

Ring Notepad comes with the next updates

(1) Support *.cf extension
(2) Using Hash function (SHA256) for better "Save Changes?" message
(3) Ring Notepad - X Button - Ask for saving changes?


.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; Better RingQt

Better RingQt
=============

RingQt comes with the next updates

(1) QStackedWidget Class
(2) QCalendarWidget Class
(3) QOpenGLFunctions Class
(4) QOpenGLContext Class
(5) QSurfaceFormat Class

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; Better Ring2EXE

Better Ring2EXE
===============

Ring2EXE is updated to works as expected when we don't have a C/C++ compiler

Where we can distribute applications and get (exe file and ringo file) in this case.


.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; Better Documentation

Better Documentation
====================

(1) RingQt Classes Chapter - The classes are sorted.


.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.7?; Better Ring VM

Better Ring VM
==============

(1) Better Error Message
(2) List2Str() function support lists contains numbers
(3) Correct support for numbers contains _ as separator
(4) Creating lists without variables (statement --> Expression --> List)
(5) IsNULL() - Not case sensitive - treat Null and null like NULL
(6) Support adding the Self object to an attribute in this object
(7) Using ':' operator then keyword will create lower case literal 
(8) Printing objects - respect decimals() function
(9) When literal is not closed - determine the start of the literal
(10) Better message when printing objects contains lists
