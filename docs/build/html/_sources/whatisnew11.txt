.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.11?; RingRayLib Extension

RingRayLib Extension
====================

Ring 1.11 comes with new extension to support the RayLib game programming library

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	load "raylib.ring"

	screenWidth 	= 800
	screenHeight 	= 450

	InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, "raylib [core] example - basic window")

	SetTargetFPS(60)

	while !WindowShouldClose() 
		BeginDrawing()
			ClearBackground(RED)
			DrawText("Congrats! You created your first window!", 190, 200, 20, WHITE)
	        EndDrawing()
	end

	CloseWindow()

Output:

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	load "raylib.ring"

	screenWidth = 800
	screenHeight = 450

	InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, "raylib [shapes] example - basic shapes drawing")

	SetTargetFPS(60)

	while !WindowShouldClose()

			BeginDrawing()

				ClearBackground(RAYWHITE)

				DrawText("some basic shapes available on raylib", 20, 20, 20, DARKGRAY)

				DrawCircle(screenWidth/4, 120, 35, DARKBLUE)

				DrawRectangle(screenWidth/4*2 - 60, 100, 120, 60, RED)
				DrawRectangleLines(screenWidth/4*2 - 40, 320, 80, 60, ORANGE)  
				DrawRectangleGradientH(screenWidth/4*2 - 90, 170, 180, 130, MAROON, GOLD)

				DrawTriangle(Vector2(screenWidth/4*3, 80),
							 Vector2(screenWidth/4*3 - 60, 150),
							 Vector2(screenWidth/4*3 + 60, 150), VIOLET)

				DrawPoly(Vector2(screenWidth/4*3, 320), 6, 80, 0, BROWN)

				DrawCircleGradient(screenWidth/4, 220, 60, GREEN, SKYBLUE)

				DrawLine(18, 42, screenWidth - 18, 42, BLACK)
				DrawCircleLines(screenWidth/4, 340, 80, DARKBLUE)
				DrawTriangleLines(Vector2(screenWidth/4*3, 160),
								  Vector2(screenWidth/4*3 - 20, 230),
								  Vector2(screenWidth/4*3 + 20, 230), DARKBLUE)
			EndDrawing()

	end

.. index:: 
	pair: What is new in Ring 1.11?; StdLib - More Functions

StdLib - More Functions
=======================

The next functions are added to the StdLib

* IsListContainsItems(aParent,aChild)
* IsBetween(nNumber,nMin,nMax)
* TimeInfo(cInformation)

Example:

.. code-block:: ring

	load "stdlibcore.ring"
	? "Using the IsListContainsItems() function" 
	aList1 = "a":"z"
	aList2 = [:h,:l,:p,:u]
	? IsListContainsItems(aList1,aList2)
	? "Using the IsBetween() function"
	? isBetween(1,3,4)
	? isBetween(4,1,6)
	? "Using the TimeInfo() function"
	? timeInfo(:date)
	? timeInfo(:year)
	? timeInfo(:time)
	? timeInfo(:hour_12)

Output:

.. code-block:: ring

	Using the IsListContainsItems() function
	1
	Using the IsBetween() function
	0
	1
	Using the TimeInfo() function
	05/24/19
