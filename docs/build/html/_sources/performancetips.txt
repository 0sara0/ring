Introduction
============

Ring is designed to be a simple, small and flexible language in the first place, but also it is fast enough for many applications.

Ring can do each of the next tasks in around 1 second using normal computers in the market during the last 5 years

(1) Compiling 100,000 lines of code
(2) Executing empty loop that count from 1 to 10,000,000
(3) Executing 1000 search operation using linear search in a list contains 100,000 items, trying to find the last item (The worst case)
(4) Creating list contains 1,000,000 items then summing all of the list items
(5) Adding 20,000 items to the ListWidget in GUI applications
(6) Adding 5,000 nodes to the TreeWidget in GUI applications
(7) Printing 10,000 messages to the terminal in Console applications

Also when we need more speed we can use C/C++ extensions!
