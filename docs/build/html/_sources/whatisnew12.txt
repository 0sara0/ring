	pair: What is new in Ring 1.12?; Load Again Command

Load Again Command
==================

Ring 1.12 comes with the Load Again command

Using this command we can load the Ring source file which contains constants more than one time.

This is useful when using Ring source files for translations through global constants.

Example:

The next function is part from a project which support Arabic and English languages

The files english.ring and arabic.ring contains constants for translation

One of these files is loaded in the start of the program

Loading the same file again using the (Load) command is not possible

Because the (Load) command load the same source file only for the first time and ignore next times.

So we have to use the (Load Again) command.

Where we can use these files again during the runtime as in the next code

.. code-block:: ring

	func setLang nLanguage
		if C_ENV_DEFAULT_LANG = nLanguage
			return
		ok
		C_ENV_DEFAULT_LANG = nLanguage
		# Change the language
			switch nLanguage 
				on C_TRANSLATION_ENGLISH
					load again "translation/english.ring"
				on C_TRANSLATION_ARABIC 
					load again "translation/arabic.ring"
			off
