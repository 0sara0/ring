========================
Package Manager (RingPM)
========================

Start ---> [Ring Compiler + VM + StdlibCore + RingLibCurl + RingInternet] < 2 Mbyte
	   Without (Libraries|Extensions|Applications)		> 1.1 GByte

Advices
=======

1 - (Start working on Common Cases First - Not General)
2 - (Start with simple methods and simple soltions)
3 - (Don't keep attacking the main problem (Development) )
 	---> After each step - Stop and revise your work first!
		(1) Your next steps will be faster 
		(2) You will Enjoy more!
	Using (ringpm) instead of (ring ringpm.ring) ---> Faster 
	Using different files 	---> More Organization 
				---> Manage Complexity
4 - Testing is important ---> Start writing tests in early stages as possible 
5 - Select good names for (File, Functions, Variables, etc)	
6 - Using (ring filename.ring) is faster for development 
	---> We move from coding to execution (fast)
	But writing the file name is slow
	---> Batch Files is faster 
7 - Before you start programming, Try to be in good mode 
	because most of **hard bugs** is a result of bad mode 
		1 - Social Problem 
		2 - Fixing Bug (Not Happy)
		3 - Deadline 
	Good Mode (Happy) ---> Careful - Focus - Better Code 

Features	
========

(1) Install [Application|Library|Extension]
	---> Install Related Packages 
(2) Remove 
	---> Delete the Related Package if it's not used by other packages 
(3) Update (To New|Old Version)
	---> Delete current version, Then install new version 
	---> Install new version, Keep the old version too 
(4) List of installed packages 

		
How we will know about the installed packages 
=============================================

(1) Get list of "package.ring" files ---> Know installed packages from these files 

	Good 	--> (1) Easy to implement
		    (2) Easy to insert packages 
		    (3) We don't repeat the package information 
	Bad 	--> (1) Depend on folders structures 
		    (2) Folders and Files processing to get the info (Slow?)
				---> Not big problem (We have fast machines)


==================
RingPM Executable		---> DONE
==================

sysargv list ---> Get parameters from the command line 

(1) When we run the app. using ring.exe 

	ring ringpm.ring  <para>
		first para : ring.exe 
		second para : ringpm.ring 
		<our program parameters> 

	ringpm <para> 
		first para : ringpm.exe 
		<our program parameters>

(2) ringpm.exe ----> Will need runtime files 
			ring.dll	---> We can avoid it using -static option in Ring2EXE
			libCurl dlls
	ring/bin folder (Beside the runtime files)

	We have ring/bin in System PATH
