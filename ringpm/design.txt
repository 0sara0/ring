========================
Package Manager (RingPM)
========================

Start ---> [Ring Compiler + VM + StdlibCore + RingLibCurl + RingInternet] < 2 Mbyte
	   Without (Libraries|Extensions|Applications)		> 1.1 GByte

Advices
=======

1 - (Start working on Common Cases First - Not General)
2 - (Start with simple methods and simple soltions)

Features	
========

(1) Install [Application|Library|Extension]
	---> Install Related Packages 
(2) Remove 
	---> Delete the Related Package if it's not used by other packages 
(3) Update (To New|Old Version)
	---> Delete current version, Then install new version 
	---> Install new version, Keep the old version too 
(4) List of installed packages 

		
How we will know about the installed packages 
=============================================

(1) Get list of "package.ring" files ---> Know installed packages from these files 

	Good 	--> (1) Easy to implement
		    (2) Easy to insert packages 
		    (3) We don't repeat the package information 
	Bad 	--> (1) Depend on folders structures 
		    (2) Folders and Files processing to get the info (Slow?)
				---> Not big problem (We have fast machines)
